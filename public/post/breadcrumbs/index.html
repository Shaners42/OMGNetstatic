<p>&ldquo;For this episode of Breaking Banks, we are setting the stage for a new era of banking experiences and capabilities in the digital payments space. Our guests today are revolutionizing digital payments and paving the way for cashless transformation. Brett King is joined by contributor Brian Solis Global Innovation Evangelist of Salesforce and YandexMoney CEO Ivan Glazachev to discuss Russia‚Äôs advancements in payments, mobile wallets, and transfers in the wake of COVID-19. <strong>Next, hear from Jun Hasegawa and K. Pitiporn Phanaphat as they chat with Brett King about blockchain technology for fintech applications</strong>.</p>
<p>With a recent investment round led by SCB10X, the Thailand based fintech SYNQA is poised to spread cashless solutions to businesses across Asia.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="partial-transcription-cheechyo">Partial transcription @cheechyo:</h2>
<p>Brett King: Let‚Äôs talk a little bit more about SCB and SYNQA. So first of all, Siam Commercial Bank, you have this 10X and this sort of moonshot mission, which we‚Äôre familiar of from Google, but these are your moonshot mission in the similar way to Google, things that investments that can create exponential growth. But tell me a little more about SCB Group‚Äôs focus on Venture Capital and investments over the past few years.</p>
<p>K. Pitiporn Phanaphat: Sure, I would maybe start a little bit on the SCB from probably 3 years ago, when we started on the transformation journey. So, including all the IT investments and ??? SCB Easy, which is the mobile banking, and so it lead to different iteration phases. And then with that mobile app, people can transfer, pay, or even do the installment of credit cards, everything through the mobile banking. And then it tried to add the lifestyles aspect into the mobile banking so that it becomes a super app in everyones phone, and becomes an every day app for the Thai people. But then, i think on that, it‚Äôs still seen as trying to digitize the bank process and using mobile banking as a channel rather than being a real ?tack farm? For business. And then at the same time it‚Äôs still working within the captive market which is the bank customers and bank product, and more like a captive market. And so last year it started with a project of 10x and this becomes an entity now, which is scb 10x with the mission that it would
invest, create, and partner with tech companies to build a business that would become the 10x, but i think the method would be different because we have our own lab, which started different platform in a lean way. And then we have our VC funds, and I think the VC fund has been there since 3 years.</p>
<p>Brett: Ok so is it still called Digital Ventures? The VC Fund?</p>
<p>K: No, the name is different now. Because Digital Venture through all 3 years have it‚Äôs own product and would like to pursue that as a business. So DV has the P2P, which is the blockchain, supply chain financing using blockchain. So DV becomes a business that would eventually ??. It‚Äôs actually doing very well and will be ?? very soon. It has good traction. So DV becomes one of the ?? 3 companies of SCB 10X.</p>
<p>Brett: We have seen a handful of banks create their own venture arms and sort of investment arms and incubation facilities, but there‚Äôs not many in Thailand that have done what SCB has done, in terms of the banks creating venture funds and incubators</p>
<p>K: Right. I think, yes. I‚Äôm not sure if the way we did it is the optimal one, so we are still learning it and trying. So we have 3 companies, like a venture building tract. So DV is one, and we have another 2 digital lending businesses called MONIX (sp?) and ABACAS (sp?). So these 3 become ??? companies that we would have to help them raise external funding in the future. The venture cap, i think it has its own trial, and doing quite ?? it has it‚Äôs a corporate venture cap. So that one, i think the size is becoming bigger and bigger. And the ??? is the strategic
investment, so similar to what we are talking today with SYNQA, we see this as a strategic investment, so that‚Äôs why we put it in a bigger ticket size, and also more substantial ownership stake. Because we see with SCB 10x, with SCB, together with SYNQA we can create a lot more, both on the traditional side of the bank, and also with the blockchain, we like that part.</p>
<p>(Brett asks K questions about remote working, then asks Jun about the history of SYNQA‚Ä¶.)</p>
<p>Brett: Now I know you guys [SCB] have been big believers in blockchain, you‚Äôve got a number of investments. 3 years ago you invested in Ripple. You‚Äôre among the top 5 financial institutions in terms of volume on the Ripple network, and you connect to over 12 countries globally. So I see where this fits in, but tell me about the process of you guys coming together, SCB and SYNQA.</p>
<p>K: We‚Äôve used SYNQA as our payment gateway partner since last year, or even 3 years ago. And some of the relationship gets deeper and deeper, and the business units are happy working with synqa. So i think with the aspiration of what synqa wants to do around the blockchain, and also how it adds into to the (?) of the bank, and also with 10x on using blockchain. So we see that as a strategic fit with fundraising, so we think it‚Äôs a good (?) to tighten up our relationship. We cannot say much in terms of some of the works that are still working together and soon to be announced, but i think that with synqa we can work together to create some of the pieces within blockchain banking, especially around payments, because we think that around programmable money that allows payment to be embedded in the business transactions, not necessary have to be the (?) but some of the digital assets including the value loyalty, i think there‚Äôs a lot more that can be done. I think that‚Äôs worked well with a lot of our retail customers at the bank today, which have pain point that they have a lot of loyalties that they want to use and it‚Äôs not real time, it‚Äôs (?) be done across the country when they travel across country, to Japan for example. We hope that some of the work we are doing within the (?) such as connecting to different partners, corporate partners, to build ewallet, loyalty, i think some of that can be top up and make a lot more through this collaboration. On top of all, you mentioned earlier on the Ripple investment and transactions. So now, from the bank, or even our mobile banking, you
can transfer money across the country through our mobile banking, and it‚Äôs almost real time, with very minimal fees. So i think for us, this is much better for the customer, in terms of cheaper, faster, and what is the other one?? Better.</p>
<p>Brett: You‚Äôre talking about payments between Thailand and Japan, but to expand that outside of thailand, are you guys talking about acting as a gateway for thai business to go offshore with payments? Do you see yourself becoming part of some blockchain payment network in the future? How do you think it might progress beyond the thai geography?</p>
<p>K: it‚Äôs definitely the latter. But then i think we need to use Thailand as the first use case, and then hopefully we can do it in the integrated way. So payment using blockchain is the only one piece of this whole jigsaw. So i think there‚Äôs a lot more on the digital bank concept. Either it‚Äôs the exchange, the stablecoin, or the tokenization. So i think we see that, it depends on the philosophy that if we are looking for one partner that has the whole staff, and then you build a whole bank that already fully integrated, or use (?) end pieces. I think for us, retail our payment
like this, i think it‚Äôs one piece, but also there‚Äôs a lot more pieces we have to develop. And also other purposes, right? So payment is one, but investment is another piece.</p>
<p>Brett: And i understand Thailand is investigating CDBC also?</p>
<p>K: Yes, so i think that‚Äôs the part that you mentioned about Digital Venture, earlier. DV right now is doing the supply chain financing using blockchain. And already gained traction with a lot of the big companies and corporates in thailand, like SET, SIEMEN, the MINER. And many more. So DV is becoming a business on it‚Äôs own and will be expanding to other countries within the region. Not even the region; global. Because we even (?) America and some other countries in Europe as well. And we‚Äôll be going through external fundraising. But at the same time DV is helping the Central Bank on the CBDC project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Currently, OMG Network&rsquo;s revenues come from 2 main segments: corporate clients, from consulting and marketing. Developing systems and solutions for the organization, including transaction fees and working with business partners in the ecosystem. Which is ready to open to startups or companies Come in to create an application Currently, most OMG Network platform users in Thailand are Rewardspoint, Loyalty Point, and Stablecoin. OMG Network will be the infrastructure to help Thai startups. Scale possible Because the problem of Thai startups is that when they are established they will only grow in the country. But if wanting to scale to other countries, there will be infrastructure problems that may have to be moved to a new start-up in that country, but OMG Network can be used in countries all over the world. <strong>Has been in testing for 2-3 people, such as Buzzebees,Event, pop, etc.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
