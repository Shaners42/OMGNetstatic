## 20200620 Buzzebees mentioned as OMG network tester on MSN news Thailand

Not much to go on: :space_invader:

Via Google translate:

> "Currently, OMG Network's revenues come from 2 main segments: corporate clients, from consulting and marketing. Developing systems and solutions for the organization, including transaction fees and working with business partners in the ecosystem. Which is ready to open to startups or companies Come in to create an application Currently, most OMG Network platform users in Thailand are Rewardspoint, Loyalty Point, and Stablecoin. OMG Network will be the infrastructure to help Thai startups. Scale possible Because the problem of Thai startups is that when they are established they will only grow in the country. But if wanting to scale to other countries, there will be infrastructure problems that may have to be moved to a new start-up in that country, but OMG Network can be used in countries all over the world. **Has been in testing for 2-3 people, such as Buzzebees,Event, pop, etc.**"
