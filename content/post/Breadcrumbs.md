## Ttranscription:

**Brett:** So B tell me how is first of all, let's get to the important things. What is Thailand like during coronavirus? Now because I know that you probably be watching the US. It's a real mess. Still, here in the United States. But how are things in Thailand?

**K:** Ohh hello right. Um thanks for the show but in Thailand is actually getting better and we have gone through almost 1 1/2 months off lockdown. So everything was closed and then everyone supposed to stay home. And in fact a lot of us are still working from home today and that's the 90% of the young commercial bank employees as well an. So I already no more cases in Thailand domestically and I like the new cases have dropped those who. We transport back from other country.

**Brett:** Do you still have quarantine for people coming to visit?

**K:** Not anymore, so you're welcome to come

**Brett:** I will be there first week of September. That's my plan right now, So

**K:** people are quite handling it. Go so a lot of other still most of us are still wearing masks, but we can now go to restaurants, shopping and no more could feel an well. I think the ratio of washing hands and then social distance thing is still mostly there in adapted base. 

**Brett:** I look forward to visiting icons. I can see him when I get back, so did they open the movie theatres yet?

**K:** Not quite, but in fact some the movie industry tried to adapt, so they use the out the car they drive entitled going to the drive in movies. Home delivery becomes very popular during the coming. During the Quarantine.

**Brett:** So B, first of all, let me ask you a bit of a fundamental question for listeners who are listening from around the world today. What is Thailand like now during the coronavirus crisis? So cause the US? I'm sure you've been seeing the news were still very much in the midst of it. But how is Thailand surviving with this very well? 

**K:**So if you remember at the beginning of Thailand is one of the very first country that got the infected cases. However, I think we implemented the lockdown white up early and now it's almost two months of lockdown an now we already came out is already 1 one month after the lockdown and people are still very mad social distancing and watched their hands regularly about now. The new cases are very low, mostly from the patients are passengers who come from abroad. No domestic new cases, but a lot of the new habits are. Some of the learnings still there, such as work from home, still 90% of the employees are still working from home and then the habits of other out and then food delivery or even some of the E Commerce did very very well during the cold period 

**Brett:** and you can go back into shopping malls and restaurants now. 

**K:** Yes all the restaurants are open and people are very keen to go back to restaurants but then up the tables will be set up. Differently so that that yes, and malls as well. So we government did quite well on implementing the app so that everyone who goes in and out of the mall has to check in through the QR code

**Brett:** so that there is a contract racing they include in the accessing the app. I mean it accessing the mall. Yeah, yeah, very good given that the mole life, particularly in Bangkok is such a big part of people's lives, it's. Yeah, very cool. So happy I'll be there first week of September hopefully. But maybe Jun, maybe I'll ask you this question, tell me a little bit more about the fintech scene generally in Thailand because it started a little later than say the US or the UK. But there's a really thriving community then now. Can you give us a little bit of perspective? 

**Jun:** Yeah, I seen you know. In the South East Asian little bit like different beast, even in Thailand because all the infrastructure is really fragmented and isolated so, but you know the I want you too, but you said about the starting from scratch. Implement unify the QR code payment system called Pompeii and I was really amazed. You know, I came from Japan and then I thought I knew most of like efficient payment process, but you know I send money but it's just a typing the phone number and anytime in the fridge which is the amazing

**Brett:** so real time frictionless, free compared with the ACH system we have in the United States which takes 5 days and costs here money and that's electronic payments. This is not paper cheques which anyway don't even get me started on this. Obviously China and Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong well ahead of the US when it comes to real time payments which a lot of Americans I think would be shocked to hear. But to see the QR codes implemented there successfully is key. 

**K:** They add on that I think. Its quite effectively doing the Covid because even the men Ben nodes are things people are afraid to hold catch right, so undecided. What are events digital and that the bank has the mobile banking? I think we have seen significant increase in both the new customers and also the transaction. So a lot of the customer segment that in the past it's quite difficult to get them on board is truly the start up the above 60 years old Segments added now they doing the Covid self onboard into the mobile is very good 

**Brett:** so old people are using electronic or digital banking. Mobile banking for the first time since covid there yeah.

**K:** Yeah, and including the number of transactions because most of the branches are closed during the covid

**Brett:** I understand, so let's talk a little bit more about SCB and Synqa. So Siam commercial bank you have this 10X and this sort of moonshot mission, which you know we're familiar with from Google, but these are your moonshot mission in a similar way to Google things that investments that can create exponential growth. But tell me a little bit more about Siam Commercial Bank groups focus on venture capital and investments. Over the past few years

**K:** transformation journey, so including out it investments and then putting developing the scb easy which is the mobile banking. And so this it went through different iteration phases and then within that mobile app people can transfer KR. Even do the instalment of credit cards. Everything over the mobile app and then it tries to add some of the lifestyles aspect into the provider incident. It becomes a super app in everyone's phone. And becomes everyday app for the Thai people but then I think on that it's still seen as trying to digitise the found process an using mobile banking as a channel rather than being a real time for more business and then at the same time it's still working within the captive market, which is a back customers and their products at more like a captive market and so last year so it started with a project of 10X and which becomes entity now which is the scb10x with a mission that it would invest and create and partner with 10 related companies to build a business that would be time from 10x. But then adding the method would be different. This I think we have our own language. Up started conforming the lean way and then we have our VC funds and then I did that. New VC fund has always been there since I'm three years ago

**Brett:** is this called Digital Ventures to be safe 

**K:** the name is different now because of injury. Throughout the three years it has developed its own product and would like to pursue that as a business. Digital Ledger has the B2P which is the blockchain supply chain financing using blockchains or digital venture become a business that would eventually respond and it's actually doing very well and will be respond very soon. So it has construction so digital venture become one of the companies of SCB10x minutes. 

**Brett:** We have seen a handful of banks create their own venture arms and creating a sort of investment arms and incubation facilities, but there's not many in Thailand that have done what I SCB has done. Is there in terms of the banks creating venture funds and you know incubators.

**K:** Right, I think yes, I I'm. I'm not sure if the way we did it is the optimal one, so we are still learning it and try and earn. So far we have developed three or fewer companies like a virtual adventure building building track. So digital venture. It's one. And then we have another two lending digital lending business card monique's an upper caste so this dream becomes Arsenal companies that we would have to help them to raise external funding in the future. The venture cap, which is I think it has its own trail and then doing quite clearly and is a corporate venture cap so that one adding the sizes becoming bigger and bigger and that is the strategy investment. So we similar to what we are talking today with Synqa. So we see this as a strategic investment. So that's why we put it in in a bigger ticket size and also more substantial ownership stake because we see that with scb10x with scb together with Synqa we can create a lot more one on the traditional side of the band and also with the blockchain elected time 

**Brett:** so you guys are big blockchain fans. You talk about Decentralising Finance a lot I know, but I want to just hone in one area. You have identified 5 areas that you invest in digital payments, digital lifestyle health Tech which includes telemedicine. Of course AI and robotics but the one area of I'm very interested in in terms of what you've been doing recently as remote working so tell me more about how you're investing in the remote working space is very important since covid.

**K:** Yes, actually it's a new area and I think it comes from the covid. Where we see it as more and more. So far a lot of them are still in the pipeline, but so it does two parts. One is the working space that economy and also the cyber security. So I think we don't have the names for you on which the company's name that we invested on. But these are one of the five spaces that will entail carefully because the covid that In addition to the health because.  During the cold with telemedicine, the health area becomes getting more traction and knew use cases has come out. So I think those are the two new area that expedited 

**Brett:** health tech is going to be very big coming out of covid for sure. So Jun san if maybe if we can get into the sort of back Storey first of all about Synqa your tie base. But you've obviously you just said before you. You spent time in Japan. There's obviously a thriving fintech community in Japan. We've done some work with the Japanese Fintech Association and others before, but tell me about how Synqa came into being an what's problem. You're trying to solve.

**Jun:** Yeah, so, the one of things that I learn not disturb the Synqa the Omise group is my fifth other starters. So I've done four before the first one that US and Japan the same time I learnt a lot from my failure. Then the one of things that I actually is eager to try is building something very significant for the People's Daily lives. So infrastructure business and then my Co founder he's uptight Kiwi, so she used to live in Japan and he went back to Thailand, but in 2011 and 2017 she's coming up by one. We just starting something in this leapfrog budget, right? An I decided to move to Thailand about 2013 and sold starting the E Commerce platform but we couldn't find any good the payment platform which was the pain pain point. We found it up an always the whole like start up community. Everyone has the same problems and then we started this payment by. Fintech understands Omise payment and then we set it up like holding company about 2015. There was a Synqa and now we are holding we subsidising a 2 main infrastructure company which is transitional payment. Omise payment translate the acceptance of technology company and the other one is called OMG network which is the blockchain based technology value transfer network. So we tried to. 

**Brett:** What is the OMG stand for? 

**Jun:** before it stood for Omisego but you know we just take it 

**Brett:** Are you guys payment gateway business say are you a back end bill payment system and E Commerce payments rails something like stripe? Or how would you categorise your business? 

**Jun:** Yeah, some people saying that like we're the Asia division of stripe 

**Brett:** Asian stripe, yeah issue that should be called Tiger or something then right? 

**Jun:** Ohh yeah, exactly. Sorry, you know one of the things you know. It's OMG network is also building from the pain point. You know when we build it Omise payment, a payment processing service for me. Try to connected about 2015 or the infrastructure, right, existing infrastructures mainframe of the banks accounts teams hyper painful because of fragmented and isolated. So Omise payment is building a means to unify connectivity. You know, when people's connected to us mate, I'm collecting the any like the payment channel, so that's one thing. But the since we found out this is a core instruction infrastructure problem, we thought why do we just build one ourself and we are looking to blockchain technology and then that becomes the OMG network.

**Brett:** So you know it's good to see blockchain being implemented in a real way in Thailand. Still a lot of the blockchain stuff we've seen hasn't got to implementation stage for many organisations, so that's a big thing. Now I know B you guys have. Obviously you've been big believers in Blockchain. You've got a number of investments three years ago. You invest in ripple. I remember your amongst the top five financial institutions in terms of volume on the ripple network and you connect over 12 countries globally. So I see where this fits in, but tell me about the process of you guys coming together, SCB and synqa. 

**K:** We started talking. I think. First of all we Synqa as our payment Gateway Partners in some during the last year or even three years ago and then some of the relationship gets even deeper and deeper and the business units are Happy working with Synqa. So I think with the aspiration of what single wants to do around the protein and also how it adds into the capability of the bank and also with that 10x on using blockchain. So we see that there is a strategic fit and then with the fundraising so we think it's a good timing to tighten up our relationship and I think we probably cannot say much in terms of some of the words that are still working together and soon to be announced, but then I think we think that Synqa can also help us. So together with Synqa we can work together to create some of the pieces within the blockchain banking, especially around the payment because we think that around the programmable money that allows payment to be embedded in the business transactions. Let's not necessary have to be just fiat currency, but then some of the digital assets, including the value. A lot more can be done and then I think that works well with a lot of our retail customers at the bank today which have pinpoint they have a lot of loyalties that they want to use that is not real time and cannot be done across the country when they travel to Japan for example, and I think we hope that some of the work that we are doing within the EU, such as connecting two different partners, corporate partners to build even. Let's allow you Theon in some of that can be topped up and make a lot more through this collaboration on top of you mentioned earlier underreport investment and transactions. So now from the even our mobile banking. You can transfer money through the mobile across the country, remittance across country through our mobile banking. And it's almost real time with very minimal fees. So I think this is for us. It's something that's much better for customers in terms of faster. And what is the other one better

**Brett:** cheaper, faster and better that's the Magic combination. So when we look at you know we're hearing a lot at the moment about technology and their upcoming IPO potentially. But part of what they've tried to do is create a wallet infrastructure, and we've seen alipay. And we've seen other other players like cacao in South Korea and G cash and have sort of become an aggregator for many of these consumer payments. But you know when you talk about a lot of what you're doing. You know you're talking about payments between Thailand, Japan, but to expand that outside of Thailand, are you guys thinking about sort of acting as a gateway for Thai businesses to go offshore with payments? Do you see yourself becoming part of some blockchain payment network in the future? How do you think it might progress beyond the Thai geography?

**K:** It's definitely the latter, but then I think we need to use Thailand as the first use case and then hopefully we can do it in the integrated way. So payment using blockchain is the only one piece of this whole jigsaw, so I think there's a lot more on the the digital bank concept. I know it's the exchange, the stable point or the tokenization, so I think we see that I think it depends on the philosophy that if you're looking for one partner who has the whole steps and then you build a whole bank that already bits and pieces, and I think for us retail or payment like this, I think it's one piece. But also there's a lot more pieces that we have to develop for different purposes, right? So payment is one, but investment is another position we have to understand 

**Brett:** So Thailand is investigating CBDC a central bank digital currency also.

**K:** Yeah yes, so I think that's the part that you mentioned about digital venture earlier. So digital venture right now is doing the supply chain financing using blockchain and already gain traction with a lot of the big companies conglomerate in Thailand like SCG, Siam or the minor and many more. So I think that little venture is becoming a business on its own and will be expanding to other countries within the region and not even the region global because we even have South America or some of the countries in Europe and then we'll be going through the external fundraising, but at the same time digital venture is helping central bank on this CBDC project

**Brett:** understand. So Jun tell me a bit more about your team that you have. How many people you've got working for you these days? How big is the team? And more importantly, what does this series C that you guys closed in in June? And what does that enable you guys to do now that you couldn't do before?

**Jun:** Yeah, so you know is a fun is a gas for the Starbucks, right? So we did a little stuff, I think before  our case now among the group we have the crossed returned 270 families an we are spread over the place we are remote company. You know we're based in Thailand but majority is a foreigner. We have a 36 nationalities so we have a quite diversified ourself and SGC is helped us to build something's connected businesses more. Because before it's beer really up building a core technology, right infrastructure layer. Let's say the blockchain, you know if we asking if somebody can you connect it to the blockchain? I don't think that not all people understand how to connect into blockchain because the end of the day the people doesn't care wether we use a blockchain or not. Usability is everything. You know what kind of a user experience which are providing to people. So we'd like to the building or something easy. Connect as like connector to the core infrastructures like service layer is more important right now because before it's just a pure a protocol, right? So no one understand that's something we want to invest at the same time. We have a great partner like SCB right now.  Before Liberation is one of the barrier to us. But now without a SCD we can break is boundary and we can get a trust which did a large customer base through the partnership. So what we can do and what we can invest is a technology and speed and the resource. So those are areas we want to invest and become the global financial infrastructures. And then you actually mean very very good questions like how we will become is kinda the cross border wallet frame work because of what it is going to be as people's real wallet is going for it right it because it work from home. People need to access to the financial infrastructure but through their mobile phone. So I think at least if people stay on the same network and the service layer, it doesn't matter. We can build whatever the like the people need and then localised what they want. So those are the things I really want to. And now we are working on with SCB? 

**Brett:** So you have the two business units you have OMG network and you have a Miso Amaia. How do you pronounce that

**Jun:** is actually came from Japanese? Yes.

**Brett:** You've got largely at Thai team over there, um Ezra Don Harinsuit Chittiprom. So you've got quite a good Thai team, so where can we find out more about Synqa and what you guys are doing right now. 

**Jun:** It's a Synqa is holding a lot of like a different name, infrastructures the businesses and then going forward. I think we extended ourselves more, but as people join going to like our website and check.

**Brett:** That's Synqa.co right? Yes yeah. Okay very good and B. How can we find out more about SCB10X 

KL Through the website also facebook? 

**Brett:** Yes Thai is one of the biggest users of Facebook for business globally. Indonesia as big as well. But Thailand does a lot of business on Facebook. It's sort of interchangeable with Internet from any ties which a lot of people don't realise.

**K:** [Something about brownies]

**Brett:** Special brownies yeah, marijuana is illegal now is legal now in Thailand for medical purposes right now. Just check. Alright well listen guys, thank you very much for coming on breaking banks today. We really appreciate your participation and really interesting to hear a little bit more about the Thai fintech scene. Jun all the best with the investment. Good luck with the continued growth and B, um I look forward to seeing, uh, seeing your team, the SCB team. When I get back to Bangkok in the latter part of the year.

Not much to go on: :bread:

> "Currently, OMG Network's revenues come from 2 main segments: corporate clients, from consulting and marketing. Developing systems and solutions for the organization, including transaction fees and working with business partners in the ecosystem. Which is ready to open to startups or companies Come in to create an application Currently, most OMG Network platform users in Thailand are Rewardspoint, Loyalty Point, and Stablecoin. OMG Network will be the infrastructure to help Thai startups. Scale possible Because the problem of Thai startups is that when they are established they will only grow in the country. But if wanting to scale to other countries, there will be infrastructure problems that may have to be moved to a new start-up in that country, but OMG Network can be used in countries all over the world. **Has been in testing for 2-3 people, such as Buzzebees,Event, pop, etc.**"
